# Self-Discipline-Temp-Name

Do you feel like you spend too much time on certain websites, or videogames? Do you wish you could cut down on the time
that you use them but not just stop using them altogether?

This program is meant to help rememdy that issue.

It asks for how much time you spend on computer entertainment like Facebook, Reddit, videogames etc. in a day, how long you wish
you would spend on them and how much time you want to get there in. Then you can input what websites and programs you
feel that you spend too much time on so that my program can block them, but not immediately. The program uses a countdown timer
so that you can still use the sites and programs you love, but with a time limit each day. This time limit decreases each day
to make it easier to reach your goal time. Once the timer hits 0 it blocks all the websites and programs the user input. When the
timer resets the next day all the websites and programs become unblocked.
